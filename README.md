# CIIISOL_ML_workshop

Traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of death around the world. One well-established strategy to deal with this public health issue is the design and deployment of road safety systems, which are in charge of predicting traffic crashes to promote safer roads. Increasing data availability has supported Machine learning (ML) to address the prediction of crashes and their severity. Transportation literature reports various methods for such purposes; however, there is no single method that achieves competitive results in all crash prediction problems. In this context, ML arises as a suitable approach to address the crash severity prediction problem.

The raw data to be analyzed in this study is obtained from Medellín’s open data portal: MeDATA. The data corresponds to traffic incidents registered by the Mobility Secretary of the Mayor’s Office of Medellín between 2014 and 2018 (see Figure 1). For the particular case of this data, a traffic incident is understood as: "an event, generally involuntary, generated by at least one vehicle in motion, which causes damage to people and goods involved in it, and also affects the normal circulation of vehicles moving along the road or roads in the place or within the area of influence of the event"
